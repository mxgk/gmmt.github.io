I will list some useful commands that I use often.

#[ vim-bundle](https://github.com/tpope/vim-bundler)
`:Bopen[!] [gem]`         With no argument, edits the Gemfile.  Otherwise,
                        effectively does a `bundle open` of a gem inside of
                        Vim, including an |:lcd| to the gem's root directory.
                        Add ! to discard the current buffer's changes.

`:Bsplit[!] [gem]`        Like |:Bopen|, but horizontally split.  Add ! to
                        suppress the |:lcd|.
                        This is very useful, you can navigate the gem in the same window.

#[ ctrl-p ]( https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim )

`:CtrlP [starting-directory]`
   Open CtrlP in find file mode.

   If no argument is given, the value of |g:ctrlp_working_path_mode| will be
   used to determine the starting directory.

   You can use <tab> to auto-complete the [starting-directory] when typing it.

`:CtrlPTag`
Tag mode:

* Name: 'tag'
* Command: ":CtrlPTag"
* Search for a tag within a generated central tags file, and jump to the
      definition. Use the Vim's option |'tags'| to specify the names and the
      locations of the tags file(s).
      E.g. set tags+=doc/tags

Better to have a shortcut for this:
`nnoremap <leader>. :CtrlPTag<cr> `
