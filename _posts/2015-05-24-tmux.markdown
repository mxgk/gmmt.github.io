## Tmux
Tmux is a tool which allows multiplexing terminals inside a single terminal.

## Pane
A terminal.

## Window
A window can contain multiple panes (terminals). Keep related panes in same window to see all. For example while I'm writing this post, there're 2  
panes on my window:
* A pane for vim
* A pane for running `jekyll serve`

## Session
A session may contain multiple windows. Typically I create a session for each different project.

## ~/.tmux.conf
Contains configuration parameters for tmux. Here's mine:


{% highlight bash %}
# Tmux default is Ctrl+b, but for me it's easier to press Ctrl+a. At least I can do it with my single hand.
unbind C-b
set -g prefix C-a

# Use vim keybindings in copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# invoke reattach-to-user-namespace every time a new window/pane opens
set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh"
#
# start selecting text typing 'v' key (once you are in copy mode)
bind-key -t vi-copy v begin-selection
# copy selected text to the system's clipboard
bind-key -t vi-copy y copy-pipe "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"
{% endhighlight %}
